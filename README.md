# Fruits Recognition
Recognition of fruits based on photos

# Introduction
The aim of the project was to create an algorithm which can recognize fruits from live camera view. The result is shown in below example of four fruits.

In the project I was basing on photos dataset found on kaggle.com and I did my own photos of fruits by PC camera an script. The distribution of fruits is shown below:
